	<h1>Spring 2026 Garden Update</h1>
	<h2>January 25, 2026</h2>
	<p>The planning and planting for the spring garden is officially under way. The layouts for both the spring and summer gardens have been added to the Gardening page. The seeds were planted on January 3rd in our seed starter setup. This will give us a good leg up on having a successful garden for the spring.</p>
	
	<p>We planted the tomatoes and peppers since they take the most time to mature for the summer garden. Hopefully this will give us the jump start we didn’t get last year. We planted the Big Rainbow and Brandywine Pink from last year and are trying the Honeycomb cherry tomato since I wasn’t able to find seeds for the Sunsugar. I thought I had kept some of the seeds but they got misplaced somehow. Hopefully, I will have a better system for saving seeds this year. The peppers are seeds that we used for last year’s bell peppers and the new addition of some jalapeno peppers.</p>

    <p>For the spring garden, we have planted cauliflower (one variety is Purple of Sicily that looks fun), broccoli, Rainbow Mix Swiss chard, Little Gem lettuce, sweet onions, and several herbs that take longer to start that will complement and support overall garden health. We are sticking with the container style garden from last year but switching up the planting style. I want the herbs to be mobile so they can be moved where they will be needed the most.</p>
   
    <p>So far everything is sprouting up well. The tomatoes and jalapeno peppers are off to a good start but I think I may need to replant the bell peppers, as they have yet to sprout. All of the spring veggies have sprouted up except for some of the herbs but I think they have a longer germination time.</p>

    <p>As things grow and need to be re-potted before planting outside, we will post updates. This year I plan to keep better records of what works and what doesn’t. I also hope to keep a better log of progress photos. I’m including some pictures below to show the growth for our seedlings so far.</p>
