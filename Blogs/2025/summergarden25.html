	<h1>Summer Garden Update</h1>
	<h2>September 30, 2025 </h2>
	<p>As fall is officially moving in, we are wrapping up the summer garden and getting the fall/winter garden planted. We had several veggies that just did not do well with the Arkansas summer heat, despite having a fairly mild and wet summer. We have learned a lot with this first garden and hope to make improvements as we go forward.</p>
	<h3>Summer Highlights</h3>
	<h4>Tomatoes & Cucumbers</h4>
	<p>The stars of our summer garden were definitely the Sunsugar Cherry Tomatoes and the Lemon Cucumber. They will be staples in our garden going forward. The Sunsugar produced nice clusters of beautiful golden cherry tomatoes that were lightly sweet. I used these very regularly in our taco salads. The Lemon Cucumbers were perfect when picked about lemon sized. I noticed that if they were left too long the seeds would start to harden and be very chewy. I loved the cucumbers because they didn’t have the bitter aftertaste that many have and were very mild in flavor. I had planned on trying to make pickles with these but canning just did not pan out this time. My aunt sent me a pressure canner, so I may experiment with it in the future.</p>

    <p>We also planted a Big Rainbow, a Pink Brandywine, and a Roma tomato. The Brandywine and Big Rainbow got huge but did not produce as many tomatoes as hoped. I think that we were over watering them due to the heat. The heat was causing them to wilt and we were not always as diligent with checking the soil moisture. Now that the temps have cooled they are both putting off more blooms and have several tomatoes on them. I am hoping to get a few good ones before it gets too cold as they both had very good flavor and were fantastic for both sandwiches and salads. The Roma was a good performer but did not have great flavor. I think that was also due to over watering as they were very watery and had little to no flavor. No salsa with this group.</p>
    <h4>Other Veggies + Fruits</h4>
    <p>We attempted to try green beans, onions, radishes, beets, carrots, bell peppers, eggplant, and okra. The okra is doing splendidly with several decent sized pods produced every 1-2 days. We have noted that they seem to be a bit hard, almost woody. I’m not sure if I am picking them too late or if it may be another watering situation. </p>
    <p>The onions, radishes and beets did not produce at all. They sprouted and did well for a short time and then either died out or never grew again. I think that the heat may have stunted them and I also wonder if the soil we used for the raised beds was too dense for them. We did not realize that it would have so many wood chips in it. </p>
    <p>The bell pepper plants are just now starting to produce and seem to be doing well. The plants looked great all through the summer but didn’t start making blooms until late August. The green beans made a small harvest early in summer and then tried to make more but the heat just beat them out.</p> 
    <p>The eggplant was also a bust as it made blooms that just fell off and then it ended up getting infested with some type of bug so we removed it from the garden. </p>
    <p>The rainbow carrots did very well and had a decent flavor. They were a bit woody in texture but I also think I left them for longer than needed.</p>
    <p>We tried to do strawberries, watermelon, and delicata squash. We ended up with 2 squashes and 2 watermelons. The squash I think was also a victim of over watering. It made tons of blooms but the squash would rot off before getting very big. The two that we ended up with were small but had decent flavor. </p>
    <p>The watermelon just did not do well in general but the seeds were older and may not have been very good. They were supposed to be yellow melons but we ended up with one tiny yellow and one medium sized red. The flavor was good but they were very mushy.</p>
    <p>We have a ton of strawberry plants that tried to produce but the berries were very small. I’m not sure what variety they are or if they were not getting something that they needed. The plants look fantastic but they just did not produce. I’m hoping next year they will do better.</p>
    <h4>Future Plans</h4>
    <p>We have just started planting for a fall/winter garden. We currently have planted kale, brussel sprouts, lettuce, spinach, sweet onions, carrots, and beets. So far the kale, brussel sprouts, and carrots are doing well. We just planted the spinach, lettuce, and onions, which have not sprouted yet. I hope to plant some bok choy, radishes, and swiss chard soon. Once the rest of the summer garden plants stop producing as well, we will plant more. </p>
    <p>I did not keep as good of a record of the summer garden as I should have. I hope that with the winter garden I can keep a better track of what is performing the best and what needs to be changed. We are having to do container gardening because the ground is so hard and rocky. So far this seems to be working well with the grow bags but we may need to move the location of some. We had several that were on the patio and it seemed like the heat from the concrete may have been causing growth issues and wilting. We plan to move everything next to the larger grow bag unit which is on the regular ground. The plants in that location did very well. Our hope is to eventually move everything from the grow bags to raised garden beds and a greenhouse. This is something that will be much farther in the future as we will have to do a lot of planning for water sources and layouts.</p>
    <p>Once we have a more stable garden situation, we hope to start working on a project for managing the garden. We have an idea in the works for monitoring soil, temperature, etc. for gardens and greenhouses. Hopefully next year we will be able to start working on this project with a little more gusto. I am excited to get started on this project because I have not found many monitors on the market that are not only affordable but mostly accurate and easy to use.</p>
    <p>As we get through the fall/winter season we will make more plans for starting the spring and summer gardens, along with an herb garden. Hopefully in keeping better track of our winter garden we will have more to share in the future, possibly even plans or layouts for the spring/summer garden.</p>
    <p>How was your garden this year? What are your garden staples or new favorites? We would love to hear from you!</p>
