	<h1>About Raven's Ridge</h1>
	<p>Raven's Ridge is our dream. We want to be as self sustainable as possible and also share our knowledge in that endeavour to help and encourage others to do the same. This isn't just in relation to gardening and animal husbandry, but also in regards to the tech we use as well.</p>
	<p>Raven's Ridge as a concept was formed in 2018, and boy has it evolved since then. What started as a goal to live off grid has had to morph several times as circumstances changed. We stopped thinking of a permanate farm style homestead and started thinking about something more fluid. We are focusing more on container style gardening and portable structures that can go with us if we need to relocate. While this has presented it's challenges, it has also taught us a lot about what actually can be done when you learn to adapt.</p>
	<p>The flip side of Raven's Ridge is more technical. We plan to create software and hardware that can be used to help manage and maintain the homestead. This part of Raven's Ridge is still developing but the goal is to help people discover that being self sustainable doesn't have to be difficult, and can be done on even the smallest scale.</p>
	<p>Envision a world that is healthy and thriving. For us that is a world that is greener. Whether that is more backyard gardens with healthy produce or reducing waste that ends up in landfills by focusing more on repairablity instead of replaceability. While the idea of living on Mars is a very fun concept, it is far off and seems much easier to care for the planet that has cared for us.</p>
